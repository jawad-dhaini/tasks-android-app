This is an android application built with android studio.
It allows you to create lists, where in each list you can create your tasks.
It has authentication, and you can sign up for new account to store your own tasks.
The database used is SQLiteDatabase.

I wrote the Java scripts located in app/src/main/java/com/example/tasks, and the .xml files located in app/src/main/res.
The rest of the files are auto-generated by android studio.
